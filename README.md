## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope that we as a group get better insight as to how music can be used by U.S political candidates. We found this interesting because on paper music is primarily used as entertainment and it's intriguing to see that politics can be involved with how certain music tracks are used. A particular question that we would love to explore would be how certain music tracks can affect a political candidate's reception on them. Perhaps if a song that sounds joyful is used in a political campaign could that affect the candidate's chances of winning that campaign? Or could it be because of the correct time and place that the music track was played that could affect the candidate's chances? These types of questions are the things that we would want to be answered. Ultimately, we want to see how a music track can directly impact a candidate's chances of winning a campaign or not.

Our dataset is from data.world and was created by FiveThirtyEight. FiveThirtyEight is a reputable and trustworthy website that specializes primarily in gathering polls throughout the United States. These polls are then analyzed through statistics and post on their website for others to view. Our dataset includes a list of U.S political candidates and the music that they used. Through their choice of music, the dataset contains whether or not there was a negative or positive reception to how it was used. As of writing, this particular data set was collected and finalized in 2016. It is 2023 so this dataset is approximately 7 years old. The purpose of analyzing this data set is because due to genuine interest in the topic. We want to see how the masses react to the choice of music made by U.S political candidates and whether or not that has a significant impact on other people's decision.
