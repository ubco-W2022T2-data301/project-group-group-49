    "My research question is: **Are more postive or negative or neutral feeling references to Donald Trump in the dataset and which theme is the most popular in reference to him?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To plan this, I'm thinking of dropping columns that may not be relevant to my question such as the album release date of the song and maybe the artist of the song. I would also drop the rows of data that are not about Donald Trump from the candidate column. I could then put together the rows that have positive, negative and neutral sentiments about Donald Trump into a subset of the dataframe and maybe use that data to create visualizations that will help me compare the sentiments, and also the popularity of the themes that he was referred to in this dataset. I was thinking of using count functions and sorting my data according to the theme Trump was refered to with. I could maybe use the years of the album for this part of the question to see what themes of reference were popular in what years to identify a trend.\n"
